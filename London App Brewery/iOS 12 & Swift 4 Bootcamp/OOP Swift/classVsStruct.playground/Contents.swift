import UIKit

/*
A class and struct can:
 
 - Define properties to store values
 - Define methods to provide functionality
 - Define subscripts to provide access to their values using subscript syntax
 - Define initializers to set up their initial state
 - Be extended to expand their functionality beyond a default implementation
 - Conform to protocols to provide standard functionality of a certain kind

 Classes have additional capabilities that structures don’t have:

- Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another.
- Type casting enables you to check and interpret the type of a class instance at runtime.
- Deinitializers enable an instance of a class to free up any resources it has assigned.
- Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class instance.
